"@skeinui/cli": patch
---

Windows: commands that edit a project (`theme use` / `add` / `init --use`, `new page`, …) work on files with CRLF line endings and keep them; the paths `skein create`, `new`, `check` report (`--json`, MCP) use `/`; `skein create` copies `public/` as it is and renames `_gitignore` in every directory.
