"@skeinui/cli": patch
---

Projects made by `skein create` are on [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev/guide/): `vp dev` / `vp build` / `vp check` (Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, Oxlint, Oxfmt), `vite` aliased to its core, lint and format set up in `vite.config.ts`, and a git hook (`prepare: vp config`) running `vp check --fix` on the staged files. `npm run check` runs `skein check` then `vp check`, and a fresh project passes it as is. Files the CLI writes into a project later are formatted with its `vp fmt`; `skein theme add` / `remove` read `themeStyles` as a formatter leaves it; `skein preview` starts `vp dev` (`vite` for older projects) and stops the server it starts.
