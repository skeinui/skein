LoginLayout: the `cover` slot of the split look is the middle of the cover (new `login-layout-cover-body`), under the brand and over the soft glow, which the layout now always draws; it used to replace all of it. The admin template's split sign-in page has a drawing and a tagline there (`pages/login/components/login-cover.tsx`).
