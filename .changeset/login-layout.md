New component LoginLayout: the page around a sign-in (or sign-up) form, in three looks for the same parts, `centered` (the form in a card in the middle), `split` (a cover on the left, the form on the right, the cover on wide screens only) and `cover` (the card over a full-page background, a soft glow or a `backgroundImage`). The brand, the title, a line under it, the form, other ways in (`providers` with `onProvider`, behind a divider), a footer, a toolbar and the split cover are slots; the brand is separate from the title so it doesn't change with the language. Every theme style draws it (`--ui-login-min-height` sets the page's height, the viewport's by default) and the theme coverage check requires `login-layout.css`.
