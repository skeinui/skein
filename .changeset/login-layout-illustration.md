LoginLayout split: the cover has a drawing of its own (`login-layout-illustration`, its accents the primary color, floating, still with reduced motion) with the tagline `coverTitle` / `coverDescription` under it; `cover` replaces it, `cover={null}` leaves the middle empty. The admin template's sign-in page passes only the tagline now, and its own copy of the drawing is gone.
